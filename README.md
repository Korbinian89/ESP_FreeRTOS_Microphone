# ESP32 Sound Playground
Initial idea of having a micro attached to an ESP32. 

Evolved over the time, f.e.
- live streaming to host and display data by MatPlotLib
- stream to file on SD card and playback on mono amp speaker
- start uploading data to firebase as simple voice recorder with cloud storage
- try to optimize to get a online walkie talkie

# Still WIP
